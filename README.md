1. In this self-project, I performed data analysis on a Spotify dataset using SQL. 
2. 
3. The dataset contained information about various songs, including their name, artist, album, duration, popularity, and other attributes. 
4. 
5. I utilized SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the data, such as the most popular songs and artists, the average duration of songs.
6. 
7. Analyzed The distribution of songs across different genres and albums using parameter like artists and popular bands in specific city and country.
8. 
9. Additionally, I used SQL to explore relationships between different attributes, such as the correlation between song popularity and duration. 
10. 
11. This project allowed me to develop my SQL skills and gain a deeper understanding of the Spotify music library.
